I did this dadjoke generator with the help of a tutorial to learn how to use Webpack 5

I got to use Webpack 5, scss, added all loaders needed for the different filetypes and babel so that the webpage will work also with older browsers.
I used also the webpack-bundle-analyzer so that you get to see what was used. Axios was used for fetching the jokes from: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/
I used also the HTMLWebpackPlugin.
